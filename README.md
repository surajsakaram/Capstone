# Classification of tumor diagnosis using Deep Learning

## Executive Summary
---

Advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled the profiling of microRNAs (miRNAs), resulting in an abundance of sequencing data that if leveraged properly has the potential for cancer classification. Previously, the diagnosis of complex diseases such as cancer has involved relying on non-molecular criteria such as the stage of cancer, tumor type (primary, metastasized, malignant, benign), and other pathological features. However, with advancements in sequencing technology and lowered sequencing costs, there is great interest in the scientific community to use genetic expression profiles to develop a more robust method of diagnosing a cancer patient with a higher degree of accuracy than standard pathology practices alone. 

By collating the expression data of a panel of miRNAs from thousands of samples derived from various cancer patients, we can apply deep learning techniques to discern patterns in expression data that otherwise could not be done feasibly from one sequencing experiment alone.

## Problem Statement

Can a deep learning model in conjunction with miRNA expression data be trained to accurately classify multiple cancer types?
